               It was on a dreary night of November<br/>
               that I beheld <del class="#PBS"><span class="supraAdd">the frame on whic</span></del> my man comple<del class="#PBS">at</del>teed<del class="#PBS">.</del>, <del class="#PBS">And</del><br/>
               with an anxiety that almost amount<br/>

               one in the morning, the rain pattered<br/>
               dismally against the window panes, &amp;<br/>

               "You have guessed right" I replied<br/>

            "occupations are at an end—I am free<br/>
            "now I hope."<br/>
            I trembled excessively: I could not<br/>
            bear to think of, &amp; far less to allude<br/>
            to the occurences of the prece<del class="#MWS">e</del>ding<br/>

            walked therefore with a quick pace,<br/>
            and we soon arrived at my colledge.<br/>
            I then reflected–and the thought made<br/>
            me shiver that the creature whom<br/>
            I had left in my appartment might<br/>
            be still there—alive and walking<br/>
            about. I dreaded to see him but I<br/>
            dreaded still more that Henry should<br/>
            behold the monst<del class="#MWS">h</del>er.
            <del class="#MWS">I therefore</del><br/>

            on the lock before I recovered<br/>

            shivering came over me. I threw<br/>
            the door open as children are accus<br/>
            tomed to do when they expect<br/>
            a spectre to stand in waiting for<br/>
            them on the other side. But<br/>
            nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully<br/>
            in–the appartment was empty, and<br/>
            my bedroon was also freed from its<br/>
